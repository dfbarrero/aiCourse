# Introduction to the R2P2 robotic simulator

## Objectives

* Install and run R2P2.

* Understand and customize R2P2 configuration files.

* Develop basic robot controllers in R2P2.

## Getting started

First of all, download and install R2P2 following the instructions given in the [R2P2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/ISG-UAH/r2p2), please, pay attention to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) first (a Python distribution that makes everything easier) and R2P2 dependencies. 

Check out the installation running a basic scenario with the following command from the folder r2p2:

```
(r2p2) paul@arrakis:~/r2p2$ python r2p2.py
```

If everything is working properly, you shoud be now watching a basic scenario with a robot that can be teleoperated with the arrows keys, as the following picture depicts.

The scenario is stored in a JSON file under the conf folder, you can change it with the argument *--scenario*. A very convenient sandbox scenario is provided in R2P2, run it with

```
(r2p2) david@arrakis:~/r2p2/r2p2$ python r2p2.py --scenario ../conf/scenario-sandbox.json
```
Check out the scenarios contained in conf and try to run some of them.

You can get all the arguments to R2P2 passing the argument *--help*.

## Basic configuration files

R2P2 stores all its configuration under the folder "conf/". There are three types of configuration files:

- Scenarios, which contain the physical environment in which the robot is placed in.

- Robots, which describes the robots, including its morphology and sensors.

- Controllers, which configures a robot controller.

R2P2 comes with a collection of scenarios, robots and controllers, each one is stored in a JSON file, which is plain text format with a straightforward syntax, as can be seen in the next example with the default scenanio:

```
{
	"stage": "../res/stage.png",
	"robot": ["../conf/robot_2.json"],
	"controller": "../conf/controller-telecom.json",
	"gui": true
}

```

The file syntax is self-explicative.

Perform the following tasks:

1. Change the initial location of the robot in the default scenario to the top-right corner. Take into account that the coordinates origin is the top-left corner and coordinates are always positive.

2. Change the robot used in the default scenario.

3. Create a new scenario based on the default scenario or any other of your choice. Please, observe that the scenario map is just an image located in the folder *res/*, so you can use any image editor such as Gimp to do it.

## Basic robot control

The basics of robot control with R2P2 is straightforward, there is a control function that receives a vector of distances and returns a tuple with linear and angular velocities. This function is invoked from within the control loop, wich is transparent to the programmer. Read the [R2P2 developer manual](https://github.com/ISG-UAH/r2p2/wiki/R2p2-documentation) to get more details about its API.

Perform the following tasks:

1.- Change the controller in the default scenario to the naïve controller and identify which behaviour this controller implements.

2.- Open the naîve controller source code (*r2p2/controllers/naive_controller.py*) and understand its code. You can browse the code with GitHub or any other tool of your choice.

3.- Open the telecom controller source code (*r2p2/controllers/telecom_controller.py*) and understand its code.

4.- Modify the telecom controller and print the sonar measures.

5.- Modify the telecom controller and print the odometry.

## Wall following behaviour

1. Implement a new controller (*wallfollowing_controller.py*) that searches and follows a wall. Use the sandbox scenario for this exercise. You can use the naïve controller (just copy the file) as a template.

## Wall following behaviour  with a FSM

1. Implement a new controller (*wallfollowing_fsm_controller.py*) that searches and follows a wall using the following Finite State Machine (FSM).

2. Extend the FSM behaviour shown in the previous section, for instance, adding a new state "Emergency stop" to avoid collisions.
